To install jupyter-notebook follow the instructions: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

To install all the required python packages run

A lot of the examples I used in this tutorial are borrowed from Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Sarah Guido, Andreas C. MÃ¼ller. See [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/).
